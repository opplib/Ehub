3. **WordPress Monrovia :**
This group help non-developer and thoes that has passion for web development but thinks it is a difficult field , have the love for web development by using Wordpress tools as a start to their learning career.

## What are the tools/languages that are  needed to develop the Ehub Community?
To answer this question , the Ehub developers team has decided to make two versions for the community and they are as follows:

|Versions | Languages|
|---------|---------|
|**Static Webpage**| Html5,Css3,JavaScript,Bootstrap4 and jQuery|
|**Responsive Site**| Mongodb, Reactjs v16, Expressjs and NodeJs (MERN Stack)|

To explain this in detail we are going to start from the following:
- **Static Webpage :** This will be for **Temporary** use only until the final design and site is up and running.
- **Responsive Site :** This will be for both development and production , for this reason we will have two seperate branches setup in this repository to ease this process.
